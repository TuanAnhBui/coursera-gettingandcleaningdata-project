# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: CodeBook for a tidy data set



The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

# Data
The data provided in the file `2nd_tidy_data.txt` was created by using transformations in the end of this note, these transformations is written by `R` language and provided in the file `2nd_tidy_data.txt`. The data is provided in a `data.frame` format with `68` variables describing the values conducted by the research.

# Transformations
Tidying the date set by following 6 steps

. STEP 0: Load data sets and assign them to variables
We load the data sets individually into variables

. STEP 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Use `rbind` to merge the training and test data into one.

. STEP 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Firstly, we extract the mean and std features from the `features` set, assign the result to a variable 
names `features_needed` and then extract the values of those needed features.

. STEP 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Using `sapply` to assign the descriptive activity names.

. STEP 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

. STEP 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
         with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Firstly use `group_by` to group the data for each activity and subject. Then use `summarize_each` with argument `funs(mean)` to 
find the mean for each measurements. Finally, write the data into a text file by `write.table`. 
Remember to use `row.names = FALSE,quote = FALSE,sep = "\t"` to have a nice printed table.
